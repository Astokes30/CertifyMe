# CertifyMe
The Certify Me program was created for  High school students who come from  poverty stricken households, who unfortunately can't 
afford to attend a college or university. Certify Me is a community based project that creates opportunities for high school students
who would like to choose any trade and get certified in that trade, without the hassle of taking out a large loan to attend college. 
I have attached a couple of screenshots of our Certify Me website.
